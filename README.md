# Svelto.ECS.Examples.Survival
Code example for Svelto ECS (https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto-ECS)

I used the Survival Shooter Unity Demo to show how an ECS framework could work inside Unity. I am not sure about the license of this demo, so use it only for learning purposes.

Most of the source code has been rewritten to work with Svelto.ECS framework. The Survival Demo is tested with unity 5.6 and 2017.3, so I cannot guarantee that it always works, but it should work with all the versions from 5.3 and above.

**Note: The folders Svelto.ECS, Svelto.Tasks and Svelto.Common, where present, are submodules pointing to the relavite repositories. If you find them empty, you need to update them through the submodule command. Check some instructions here: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example/wiki**
